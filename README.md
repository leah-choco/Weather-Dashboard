# Weather-Dashboard
Deployed Application:  https://leah-choco.github.io/Weather-Forecast/

This application allows you to search different cities for today's weather conditions as well as the future forecast. 

## Description:
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Jquery.

I decided for this project to use HTML templates in the Javascript, so the HTML is relatively bare.

In the CSS, I was able to style all the traditional things, but also style classes that I added in the HTML templates in JS. 

For the Javascript, I really enjoyed implementing things that I have been learning recently in my bootcamp. The first would be using arrow functions instead of the traditional syntax. The second would be adding templates that can dynamically be added to the DOM. I also think it was crazy important for me to read the API documentation. I feel proficient in that at this point.
