# Weather-Dashboard
Deployed Application: https://leah-choco.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

This app allows you to search different cities for the current weather as well as the 5 day Forecast.

## What I Learned:
The goal was to use 2 API calls. I tried this time to use Ajax instead of fetch.
This was by far the most code I have written and found it challenging with all the curveballs given to us in the assignment. 
I struggled specifically with authorization with the API keys. When I used the API key of my tutor everything worked properly.
